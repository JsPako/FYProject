					I was born and raised in Leeds, and I studied college there before applying to the University of Manchester. I had no problem moving to the university dorms, where I made friendships with my flatmates. However, one thing that I had a problem with was the way we had to study. I used to go to classes and understand what was going on; then, I would get high marks in my finals without even reviewing. Nonetheless, you can't do that in university; you have to prepare and understand the videos, notes, and documents they uploaded before attending the lecture. In class, the professor only answers the students' questions or solves questions to make sure we understand certain concepts. I found it challenging to get used to this way of self-study, but after a month, I was catching up, and I got grades that I'm proud of at the end of semester one.

                  For my first semester, the academic performance I gave was fantastic since I took AP physics and maths. However, I had to live in a hotel for around a month because I struggled to find an apartment. I came from abroad, where the renting system is different, and I didn’t realise how much research I should do before travelling. After looking at many apartments at the end of the month, I found a lovely apartment with everything I needed or wanted. 
                  <br />
				  For my second semester, I had coding and computational thinking classes in which I had no background. It was hard initially, but I made it my primary goal to focus on studying. Hence, we had group work for both courses that needed programming; it was easier to understand, practice, and get help.

                  As a foundation year student at the University of Manchester, my experience had its ups and downs. To proceed to computer science, I had to study physics as an optional course, which was surprising to me as I'm not too fond of physics. I struggled to solve the questions, even after watching the videos multiple times. However, after a lot of work I got a decent mark in the final exam. Moreover, as an international student, I thought it would be hard to gain friends; however, most students are friendly and welcoming. I was not a social person, but being compelled to get out of my comfort zone to get help with questions certainly gave me a couple of friends.

                  Meeting my flatmates for the first time was really scary because they're new people. I don't know them, but it's really exciting getting to know new people and, you know, people that I'm going to be living with for the following year. 
				  The most exciting thing about living with new people is getting to know different accents and cultures because everyone has a different story, so there are new stories and things to learn on the way. 
				  So, when meeting new people, shyness is really common. But my top tip for that would be to try new things - and even meet new friends at university; you're going to meet them in different places, so you should try all societies that you can and, you know, just try everything: leave no stone unturned.
